Purpose
This document breaks every MVP engineering task into the smallest practical steps and defines explicit testing logic for each step so you always know whether to debug or move forward.
* Mobile-first web implementation assumed (Next.js + Tailwind)
* This is a build-order checklist, not a high-level design doc
________________


Key Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
* 16-word bank displayed as a 4×4 grid
   * 6 correct words
   * 10 dummy words
* 4 total guesses
* Progressive column reveal (Wordle-style)
* Local device midnight reset
* No hints
* No multi-word phrases
* Proper nouns allowed
* Archive play enabled
________________


How to Use This Checklist
* Work top to bottom. Do not start a later task until the current task’s tests pass.
* After each step, run the listed tests.
* If any test fails, stop immediately and debug. Do not “push through.”
* Use one sample puzzle (hardcoded or seeded) until the full game loop is perfect.
* Always test on a real phone browser at least once per epic (iOS Safari / Android Chrome).
________________


Global Definitions (For Consistency)

The 8 vertical chain positions:
   * Word1 fixed
   * Word2–Word7 editable
   * Word8 fixed
   * Attempt / Guess Column
