Word Chains — Initial Game Specifications (v1)
________________


Overview
Word Chains is a daily, mobile-first word puzzle game designed for college-educated adults.
The experience is inspired by Wordle and Connections, but introduces a new mechanic: sequential linguistic reasoning.
Players must reconstruct a hidden 8-word chain using a limited number of guesses and a mixed word bank containing both correct and misleading words.
The game prioritizes:
* clarity
* fairness
* replayability
* shareability
* minimal UI friction

Validation & Feedback
Validation occurs after each guess and follows Wordle-style rules:

   * Correct word in correct position
* Yellow
   * Correct word, wrong position
* Red
   * Word not in the solution
Additional Validation Rules
* Validation colors persist across guesses

   * Yellow overrides red
* Bank tiles show outline colors based on best-known state
* Words used in the active guess are greyed out in the bank

Progressive Column Reveal
To reduce visual overload and scrolling:
* Guess 1:
   * Only the active column is visible
* Guess 2:
   * Guess 1 (validated) + Guess 2 (active)
* Guess 3:
   * Guesses 1 & 2 (validated) + Guess 3 (active)
* Guess 4:
   * Guesses 1–3 (validated) + Guess 4 (active)
Previous guesses are read-only once validated.
